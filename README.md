<img src="bot-animate.gif" alt="Bot Says Hi" width="200" height="150"/>

## Who am I?
This is me, and here's [my twitter handle](https://twitter.com/1st_opensrc_cmt).

## What do I do?
I tweet beginner-friendly GitHub issues to help developers start their open source contribution
journey.

## Who are you (the reader)?
* Someone who is new to coding. :relaxed:
* Someone who has been coding for a while, but has never contributed to open source projects. :relieved:
* Neither of these and now wondering why are you here? :flushed:

## How can I help you?
* Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/1st_opensrc_cmt).
* Keep an eye out for various issues which I tweet.
* Grab any issue which you like or find easy.
* Make your first open source contribution.
* And that's it! You did it. :bowtie:

> That's one small step for [a] developer, one giant leap for open source community.
